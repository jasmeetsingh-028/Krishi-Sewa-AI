  "Introduction": "Sesamum (Sesame indicum) is an important oilseed crop. Its oil content varies between 46 and 52%. Sesamum oil is used for cooking, for anointing the body, in the manufacture of perfumes. It also has medicinal value. Its oil cake is nutritious food for milch cattle.",
  "Requirement": {
    "Climate": "Sesamum grows in the plains an at elevations up to 1,200m. It cannot stand frost, continued heavy rain or prolonged drought.",
    "Soil": "They are grown on a variety of soils ranging from light to heavy and sandy to black soils provided they are well drained. Sandy loams with adequate soil moisture and neutral in reaction are more suitable. The pH of sesamum growing soils ranges from 5.5 to 8.5."

  "Land preparation and sowing": {
    "Preparation": "About 2 ploughing are necessary to obtain fine tilth. This is followed by harrowing and levelling.",
    "Sowing_method": "The crop should be sown in lines.",
    "Spacing": {
      "between_rows": "30cm",
      "between_plants": "15cm"
    },
    "Seed_preparation": "Seed should be mixed with sand in 1:3 ratio.",
    "Seed_rate": "3-5kg per hectare",
    "Seed_treatment": "Seeds must be treated with captan or thiram at 3 g/kg of seed."

    "Weeding": "The hand-weedings followed by one hoeing during early crop period should be done to keep the crop free from weeds.",
    "Thinning": "Thinning must be done 14 days after germination.",
    "Irrigation": "In case of irrigated crop, give the first irrigation after sowing and second 25-30 days after sowing when the plants are 15cm tall. It is essential to irrigated the crop during flowering and capsule formation stage."

  "Irrigation": {
    "Requirement": "It requires only light irrigations as water logged areas affect germination.",

        "name": "Leaf spots",
        "description": "Leaf spots appear at all stages of the crop.",
        "Control": "Using resistant varieties and seed treatment with thiram at 3 g/kg seed are the best ways to avoid the disease. Spray mancozeb (dithane M-45) 2g/litre of water to contain the disease."
