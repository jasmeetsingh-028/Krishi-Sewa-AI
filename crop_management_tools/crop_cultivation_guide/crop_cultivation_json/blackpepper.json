  "Introduction": {
    "scientific_name": "Piper nigrum L.",
    "common_name": "Black pepper",
    "title": "King of Spices",
    "family": "Piperaceae",
    "origin": "Indigenous to the tropical forests of Western Ghats of South India.",
    "economic_importance": "One of the important and earliest known spices produced and exported from India. India accounts for 54% of the total area under pepper in the world but its share of production is only 26.6 %.",
    "plant_description": {
      "type": "Perennial climbing evergreen vine",
      "height": "10 m or more",
      "branches": "Vines branch horizontally from the nodes, do not attain length, but the fully-grown vines completely cover the standard presenting the appearance of a bush.",
      "leaves": "Broadly lanceolate, but wide variations occur in leaf shape and are arranged alternately.",
      "inflorescence": "A catkin produced at the nodes opposite to the upper leaves.",
      "flowers": "Very minute. Monoecious or dioecious or hermophrodite forms occur in different varieties.",
      "fruit": "A single seeded berry, which has a thin, soft pericarp surrounding the seed.",
      "maturity_period": "Approximately six months to mature after flowering."
    },
    "spike_shedding_control": "Spike shedding occurs to the extent of 14 to 65% causing considerable loss. Spraying of IAA 50 ppm or planofix 50 ppm and or zinc 0.5% at the time of berry setting stage reduces spike shedding."

  "Propagation": {
    "method": "Propagated by cuttings raised mainly from the runner shoots.",

    "cuttings_preparation": "After trimming the leaves, cuttings of 2 to 3 nodes each are planted. Cuttings from middle 1/3 of the shoots are desirable as they are high yielding.",
    "planting": "Cuttings are planted either in nursery beds or polythene bags filled with fertile soil.",
    "care": "Adequate shade is to be provided and irrigated frequently.",
    "readiness": "The cuttings will strike roots and become ready for planting in May-June.",
    "lateral_branches": "Seldom used for propagation, as vines are generally short lived and bushy. However, they are useful in raising pepper in pots."
  },
  "Selection of site": {
    "land_type": "Well drained level land and hill slopes are suitable.",
    "slope_preference": "When grown on a slopy land, avoid south-facing slopes. The lower half of north and north eastern slopes are preferred to protect vines from the scorching sun."

    "with_coconut_arecanut": {
      "distance_from_trunk": "100 to 120 cm away from the tree trunk.",

      "transplanting_to_trunk": "After one year, the vine is separated from the temporary stake, lower leaves are nipped off, and the vine is placed in a narrow trench (15 cm deep and wide) leading to the tree trunk. The growing tip is tied to the trunk and the rest of the vine in the trench is covered with soil."

    "initial_growth": "As cuttings grow, shoots are tied to the standards. Young vines should be protected from hot sun with artificial shade.",

    "mulching": "Adequate mulch with green leaf, sawdust, coir dust, or organic matter should be given towards the end of northeast monsoon. The base of the vines should not be disturbed.",
    "from_fourth_year": {
      "lopping": "Done carefully to regulate the height of the standards and to shade the pepper vines optimally. Excessive shading encourages pest infestation.",
      "pruning": "The top of the vine is normally pruned after it has reached the required height (e.g., 6 m) for convenience of picking.",
      "digging": "Two diggings are given: one during May-June and the other towards the end of southwest monsoon in October-November.",
      "cover_crops": "Growing cover crops like Calapogonium mucanoides, Mimosa invisa are recommended under West Coast conditions."
