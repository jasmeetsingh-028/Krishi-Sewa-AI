  "Introduction": {
    "summary": "Cabbage is an introduced vegetable crop in India, adapted well and grown all over the country. It is a rich source of vitamins A, B, C and minerals like phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sodium, and iron. Its consumption aids in preventing constipation, increasing digestion, and appetite, and is considered good for diabetics.",
    "uses": [
      "Cooked vegetable",
      "Salad ingredient mixed with tomato, green chilies, beet root, etc.",
      "Pickle"
    ],
    "description": "The cabbage consists of thick leaves overlapping tightly on a growing main bud called a 'head'. It is convenient to grow on both large and small-scale (kitchen garden) cultivation.",
    "cultivation_areas": "Cabbage is grown throughout the country, being more popular in Southern States where it is available year-round. In northern India, the availability period has been extended with the development of tropical varieties/hybrids."
