  "Introduction": {
    "description": "Sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Pers.), popularly known as jowar, is the most important food and fodder crop of dryland agriculture.",
    "statistics": {
      "annual_area": "17 to 18 million hectares",
      "annual_production": "8 to 10 million tonnes"
    },
    "origin": "Sorghum is originated in India and Africa. It is also said that its origin is Abyssinia and from there it was brought to USA and European countries.",
    "growing_regions": "Jowar is mainly concentrated in the peninsular and central India. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (the Bundelkhand region) and Tamil Nadu are the major jowar â€“ growing states. Other states grow sorghum in small areas primarily for fodder.",
    "uses": {
      "human_food": "The sorghum grain is used primarily as human food in various forms, such as roti or bhakri (unleavened bread), or is cooked like rice. Sorghums are also malted, popped and several local preparations are made.",
      "fodder": "Green and dried fodder is the most important roughage for feeding cattle throughout the country.",
      "other_uses": "The utilization of grain sorghum as a cattle feed, poultry ration and other industrial uses is at present not very significant, although considerable scope exists."
    }
  },
  "Climate and soil": {
    "climate": {
      "hardiness": "Sorghum plants are very hardy and can withstand high temperature and drought.",
      "growing_conditions": "It is grown in arid regions of U.P, Rajasthan and humid regions of Bengal and Bihar.",
      "temperature_range_celsius": "15 to 40",
      "annual_rainfall_mm": "400 to 1000"
    },
    "soil": {
      "ideal_type": "The clayey loam soil rich in humus is found to be the most ideal soil.",
      "ph_tolerance": "5.5 to 8.0",
      "drainage": "A good sorghum soil must have an efficient drainage facilities though, it may withstand water logging more than maize."
    }
  },
  "Land Preparation": "Deep summer ploughing with mould board plough soon after rabi crop is harvested and leaving the soil exposed to sun until onset of monsoon is a common practice. With the onset of monsoon the land should be ploughed twice by country plough. But the soil for grain crop should be pulverised for a fine tilth by harrowing and cross plankings. If desired, field should be levelled before sowing so that rainwater may be well distributed throughout the field.",
