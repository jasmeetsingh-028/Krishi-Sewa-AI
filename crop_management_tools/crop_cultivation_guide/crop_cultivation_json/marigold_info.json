  "Importance": [
    "Marigold is one of the most commonly grown flowers for garden decoration and extensively used as loose flowers for making garlands for religious and social functions.",
    "It has gained popularity amongst the gardeners on account of its easy culture and wide adaptability.",
    "Its habit of free flowering, short duration to produce marketable flowers, wide spectrum of attractive colours, shape, size and good keeping quality has attracted the attention of flower growers.",
    "Marigolds are ideal for cut flowers, especially for making garlands.",
    "They can be planted in the beds for mass display or grown in pots. The French Marigolds are suitable for hanging basket and edging.",
    "The demand for Marigold flowers during Dashara and Diwali is very high."
  ],
  "Climate": [
    "Marigold requires mild climate for luxuriant growth and flowering.",
    "The optimum temperature range for its profuse growth is 18-20°C.",
    "Temperatures above 35°C restrict the growth of the plants, which leads to reduction in flower size and number.",
    "In severe winter, plants and flowers are damaged by frost."
  ],
  "Soil": [
    "Marigold can be grown in a wide range of soils, as it is adapted in different soil types.",
    "French (Dwarf) marigolds are best cultivated in light soil whereas a rich well drained, moist soils are best suited for African (Tall) marigolds.",
    "Sandy loam soil with pH 5.6 to 6.5 is ideal for its cultivation."

    }
  ],
  "Land preparation": "For the main-field, the land should be ploughed well followed by 2-3 harrowing and mixing of FYM @ 20-25 t/ha should be incorporated to the soil. Make the ridges and furrow properly.",
  "Propagation": [
    "There are two common methods of propagation of marigold i.e. by seeds and by cuttings.",
    "Plants raised from seeds are tall, vigorous and heavy yielder and hence, seed propagation is preferred to cuttings."
  ],
  "Nursery rising": [
    "The marigold seeds are black in color and remain viable for about 1-2 years for rising of seedlings.",
    "Seed germinate in 5-7 days. Before sowing the seeds should be treated with captan 2g/kg of seed to prevent damping off.",
    "Seeds should be sowed in pots, seed boxes or raised nursery beds.",
    "Nursery beds are prepared by digging area and incorporating well rotten FYM.",
    "Before sowing the seeds, the soils should be drenched with Captan to avoid the ants, which carry away the seeds.",
    "Seeds should be sown thinly (6-8 cm row to row) and 2cm deep and covered with sieved leaf mold.",
    "The nursery beds should be remained moist during entire period.",
    "The quantity of seed required depends upon the level of its purity and germination rate.",
    "Generally 200-300g seed/acre is required for raising the nursery in summer and rainy season, and 150-200g/acre for winter season.",

    "Rainy season crops are irrigated according to the climate.",
    "Constant moisture supply be maintained from bud formation to harvesting of flowers."
  ],
  "Pinching/ nipping and earthling up": [
    "Three weeks after transplanting earthling up is done and then one week after earthling up or 1 month after transplanting the seedlings.",
    "Pinching is followed for bushy growth of the plant and development of lateral branches.",
    "Pinching is generally done for the 40 days after transplanting, late pinching at 50-60 days proved less effective for branching.",
    "Pinching results into production of more number of flowers."
