    "Climate": {
      "regions": "temperate regions",
      "adaptation": "Genetic and agro-technological improvements have now extended its frontiers to higher latitudes of subtropics as an irrigated winter crop."

  "Sowing": {
    "method": "Sown in lines, about 50cm apart either on flat beds or on ridges.",
    "seedbed_preparation": "The seedbed is prepared in the same manner as for rabi sowings. The land is prepared to a good tilth by repeated ploughing and planking.",
    "seed_rate": "About 10kg of unprocessed seed is sufficient to sow one hectare.",
    "seed_treatment": "To facilitate germination, the seed may be soaked in 0.25% solution of a mercurial compound or Aretan or Agallol overnight.",
    "sowing_condition": "The seed can be sown when it is dry.",
    "sowing_time": "The first fortnight of October.",
    "sowing_delay_effect": "The crop has a poor tolerance to delays in sowing and sowings beyond October are detrimental to yield and sugar content.",
    "techniques": [
      "dibbling manually",
      "drilling"
    ],
    "depth": "about 3cm deep"
  },
  "Fertilizer": {
    "nitrogen": "120kg per hectare",
    "phosphorus": "80 kg per hectare in deficient soils",
    "potassium": "100kg of potash per hectare in deficient soils",
    "application_schedule": "The nitrogen fertilizer is given in three splits at sowing, thinning, and earthing-up in December."
  },
  "Irrigation": {
    "frequency": "8-10 irrigations, depending upon the seasonal conditions.",
    "importance": "Timely irrigation is very essential to ensure of good yield of the roots.",
    "critical_phases": "formative leaf growth and root development",
    "warning": "Excessive irrigation to the crop is highly detrimental to root quality."
  },
  "Plant protection": {
    "Pest": {
      "name": "Cutworms",
      "damage": "This pest is likely to spread rapidly in the tender crop and cause serious damage.",
      "Control": "Spraying 20% E.C. Heptachlor diluted in 3,500 litres of water per hectare."
    },
    "Disease": {
      "name": "Seedling rot",
      "Control": "Control includes seed polishing and seed treatment with 20kg of PCNB per hectare as soil drench before the appearance of the disease."
    }
  },
  "Harvesting": {
    "method": "A country plough is run along the sugar beet rows on both sides. This operation facilitates the lifting of the roots with a slight pull of the kudali.",
    "post_harvest_handling": {
      "cleaning": "The plants after uprooting should be freed from the adhering soil, but the roots should not be washed in water for cleaning, as this practice induces rapid deterioration.",
      "topping": "The roots must be topped clean. Leaves or leaf bases allowed to remain on the roots seriously affect the recovery of sugar."
