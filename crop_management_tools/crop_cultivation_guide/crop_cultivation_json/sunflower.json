  "Introduction": "Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L). is mainly grown for its oil. The oil is used for culinary purpose in the preparation of vanaspati and in the manufacture of soaps and cosmetics. Its cake is rich in protein and is used as a cattle and poultry feed.",
  "Requirement": {
    "Climate": "This crop requires a cool climate during germination and seedling growth, warm weather from the seedling stage up to flowering and non-cloudy, sunny days during flowering to maturity.",
    "Soil": {
      "description": "It performs well in deep, neutral and well-drained light soils as well as in heavy soils.",

  "Land preparation and sowing": {
    "season": "Sunflower is one crop in the case of which, the season of planting are not the limiting factors.",
    "preparation": "Three to four ploughing and diskings are sufficient for preparing the land.",
    "soil_condition": "Soil should be moist at least 10cm deep before sowing and this condition necessitates good soaking rains or irrigation before sowing.",
    "seed_rate": "8-10kg of well-filled seeds per hectare.",
    "seed_treatment": {
      "purpose": "For controlling seed-borne fungal diseases",
      "method": "Seed treatment with either Brassical or Captan @3g per kg of seed is recommended."
    },
    "pre_soaking": "The pre-soaking of seed for 12-24 hours ensures a rapid and high percentage of germination, an early emergence and establishment of the crop.",
    "sowing_method": {
      "depth": "5cm",
      "spacing": "45cm between rows and 30cm between plants in the row."

  "Fertilizers": {
    "recommendation": "The crop performs best when both organic and inorganic fertilizers are applied to it.",

  "Harvesting and yield": {
    "maturity": "90-100 days",
    "harvesting_indicator": "The crop has to be harvested when the lower side of the head turns yellow and some of the bracts dry up.",
    "process": "The mature heads are cut with a sickle and are dried by exposing the upper side with seeds to the sun. The well-dried heads are beaten with sticks to separate the seeds.",
